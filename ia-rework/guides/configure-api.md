# Configure an API in Auth0

To configure an [API](/api-auth/apis.md) in Auth0, you will need to access the [Auth0 Dashboard](${manage.url)}). Once you have done so, you can follow the instructions below.

1. From the left menu, click [APIs](${manage_url}/#/apis).

::: note
Inside the API section, you will see one API that has been created automatically--the **Auth0 Management API**. For details about the features of the Management API and its available endpoints, you can visit the [Management API Explorer](/api/management/v2).
:::

2. Click the **+ Create API** button, and provide the following information for your API before clicking **Create**:

- **Name**: a friendly name for the API. Does not affect any functionality.

- **Identifier**: a unique identifier for the API. We recommend using a URL (this doesn't have to be a publicly available URL; Auth0 will not call your API at all). This value **cannot be modified** afterwards.

- **Signing Algorithm**: the algorithm with which to sign the tokens. The available values are `HS256` and `RS256`. When selecting `RS256`, the token will be signed with your tenant's private key. For more details, visit [Signing Algorithms](/concepts/signing-algorithms).

Once you do so, you will be navigated to the *Quick Start* of your API. Here you can find details on the implementation changes you have to do to your API, which basically consists of choosing a JWT library from a predefined list and configuring this library to validate the Access Tokens in your API.

The other available views for your API are:

- **Settings**: lists the settings for your API. Some are editable. Here you can change the token expiration time and enable offline access (this way Auth0 will allow your applications to ask for Refresh Tokens for this API). For details, refer to the [API Settings paragraph](#api-settings).

- **Scopes**: here you can define the scopes for this API, by setting a name and a description.

- **Machine to Machine Applications**: lists all applications for which the **Client Credentials** grant is **enabled**. By default, this grant is **enabled* for [Regular Web Applications](/applications/webapps) and [Machine to Machine Applications](/applications/machine-to-machine). You can authorize any of these applications to request Access Tokens for your API. Optionally, you can select a subset of the defined scopes to  limit your authorized application's access. 

- **Test**: from this view, you can execute a sample Client Credentials flow with any of your authorized applications to check that everything is working as expected.

### API Settings

Click on the *Settings* tab of your [API](${manage_url}/#/apis) to review the available settings:

- **Id**: A unique alphanumeric string generated by Auth0. The information is read only and you will only need it if you will be working directly with [Auth0's Management API Resource Servers endpoints](/api/management/v2#!/Resource_Servers/get_resource_servers_by_id).

- **Name**: A friendly name for the API. Does not affect any functionality. The following characters are not allowed: `< >`.

- **Identifier**: A unique identifier for your API. This value is set upon API creation and cannot be modified afterwards. We recommend using a URL but note that this doesn't have to be a publicly available URL, Auth0 will not call your API at all.

- **Token Expiration (Seconds)**: The amount of time (in seconds) before the Auth0 Access Token expires. The default value is 86400 seconds (24 hours). The maximum value you can set is 2592000 seconds (30 days).

- **Allow Skipping User Consent**: When a first party application requests authorized access against an API with the *Allow Skipping User Consent* flag set, the User Consent dialog will not be shown to the final user. Note that if the hostname of your application's **callbackURL** is `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` the consent dialog will always be displayed.

- **Allow Offline Access**: If this setting is enabled, Auth0 will allow applications to ask for Refresh Tokens for this API.

- **Signing Algorithm**: The algorithm to sign the tokens with. The available values are `HS256` and `RS256`. When selecting `RS256` (recommended) the token will be signed with the tenant's private key. This value is set upon API creation and cannot be modified afterwards. For more details on the signing algorithms see the [Signing Algorithms paragraph](#signing-algorithms) below.
