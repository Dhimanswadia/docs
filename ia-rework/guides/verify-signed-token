# Verify an RS256-signed Token

To use the Public Key to verify a JWT Signature on the [JWT.io](https://jwt.io) website, you will need to find and copy the Public Key in Auth0 and use it in the [JWT.io Debugger](https://jwt.io/#debugger) website.  

## Copy the Public Key in Auth0

1. Go to [Dashboard > Applications](${manage_url}/#/applications). 
2. Open the **Settings** for your application. Scroll down and click ** Show Advanced Settings**. 
3. Open the **Certificates** tab. 
4. You will find the Public Key in the **Signing Certificate** field. Copy it.

## Verify the JWT Signature

1. Visit [JWT.io Debugger](https://jwt.io/#debugger).
2. Locate the **Verify Signature** section, and paste the Public Key in the **Public Key or Certificate** field.

If you want to verify the signature of a token from one of your applications, we recommend that you get the Public Key from your tenant's [JSON Web Key Set (JWKS)](/jwks). Your tenant's JWKS is `https://${account.namespace}/.well-known/jwks.json`.
