::: panel Verify an RS256 signed token
Go to [Dashboard > Applications](${manage_url}/#/applications). Open the **Settings** of your applications, scroll down and open **Advanced Settings**. Open the **Certificates** tab, and you will find the Public Key in the **Signing Certificate** field.

If you want to use the Public Key to verify a JWT signature on [JWT.io](https://jwt.io/), you can copy the Public Key and paste it in the **Public Key or Certificate** field under the **Verify Signature** section on the [JWT.io](https://jwt.io/) website.

If you want to verify the signature of a token from one of your applications, we recommend that you get the Public Key from your tenant's [JSON Web Key Set (JWKS)](/jwks). Your tenant's JWKS is `https://${account.namespace}/.well-known/jwks.json`.
